# 3dg
3dg is a simple web application that generates graphs of multivariable functions using [`vis.js`](http://visjs.org/). Much of this code was borrowed from the `vis.js` tutorials. 

## How to use
Clone or download the source code. If you download the `zip` file, extract the contents to your desired location. Open `3dg.html`. 

## Wish list
- []Catch undefined values of the function.
- [x] User controls for graph options.
- [] Better layout.
- [] [MathQuill](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill)/[KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) integration for better equation displays. 
- [] Multiple functions graphed at once. 
- [] Clever equation parsing (ex: sinx instead of Math.sin(x)).
